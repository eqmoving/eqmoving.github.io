<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>



<p>Protecting your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy covers all &ldquo;Supplies For Moving, Inc.&rdquo; websites. All of our websites contain similar product line, with slight variations and multiple services.</p>

<p>We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand our Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.</p>

<p>Why we collect personal information &ldquo;Supplies For Moving&rdquo; collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you.</p>

<p>Types of information that we collect We collect your name, address, phone number, email address, billing information including credit card number and expiration date as well as prospect information such as an alternate address for shipping. We only use your name, address, billing information/credit card information to process your order. The email address is used to contact you if there are issues processing your order and/or to notify you when your order has been processed.</p>

<p>If you request a free moving quote from one of our affiliates, your name, address, email, phone number and specifics pertaining to your moving requirements are forwarded to a local moving company to provide you with your requested moving quote. If you do not want your information shared with a local moving company please do not use this free moving service estimate.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances will we use this information for anything else not described in this privacy notice.</p>

<h3 id="when-we-disclose-personal-information">When we disclose personal information</h3>

<p>When you place an order, the only companies aware are &ldquo;Supplies For Moving&rdquo;, credit card services and our FedEx® delivery service.</p>

<p>If you fill out our form to receive a free moving estimate, that information you supply alone will be forwarded to a local moving company to supply you with an estimate for your move. At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. This has never happened, nor do we expect it to, and even in this circumstance, we will do everything legally possible to keep your information private.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-protect-your-personal-information">How we protect your personal information</h3>

<p>Supplies For Moving safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures.</p>

<p>The Supplies For Moving Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where financial information is required. To make purchases from the Moving Day Boxes Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.</p>

<p>All websites connected to the internet are theoretically vulnerable to break in. Assuming we do have a security breach, a hacker wouldn&rsquo;t find much on our system. We only store the last six digits of card numbers which wouldn&rsquo;t help them at all. The first digits are &ldquo;piped&rdquo; straight out to e-mail, and are never written to disk at all.</p>

<p>Our central Information Database is not networked to the outside world. This means there is no way a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; could access this stored information after the order is complete since this system is not networked.</p>

<p>The first thing you should do if you believe your credit card has been fraudulently used is to call the business where the transaction took place. If the issue cannot be resolved this way, call your credit card company - If there is a dispute, they will credit your account and perform an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="access-to-your-personal-information">Access to your personal information</h3>

<p>You always have access to the information we have about you. To review and update your personal contact information, simply call us at 718-768-7024. If you would like to review other personal information that Supplies For Moving may have about you, email us at privacy@suppliesformoving.com. Never submit credit card information via email.</p>

<h3 id="collecting-other-personal-information">Collecting other personal information</h3>

<p>When you browse Supplies For Moving&rsquo; website, you are able to do so anonymously. We don&rsquo;t collect personal information when you browse - not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using and other statistical &ldquo;impersonal&rdquo; information.</p>

<p>Like many websites, the Supplies For Moving website uses &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; technology. When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.</p>

<p>Sometimes we use a &ldquo;click-through URL.&rdquo; When you click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.</p>

<h3 id="our-companywide-commitment-to-privacy">Our companywide commitment to privacy</h3>

<p>To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Supplies For Moving employee involved in this process. In addition, Supplies For Moving participates in industry initiatives to preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic commerce.</p>

<p>Supplies For Moving does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.</p>

<p>Supplies For Moving website contains links to other sites. Supplies For Moving does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.</p>

<p>The Supplies For Moving Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes. Regardless of later updates or changes to our privacy notice, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use.</p>
