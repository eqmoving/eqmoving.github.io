      <description>White unprinted newspaper. Recommended for wrapping fragiles, stemware, small pictures, china. A must to use as a cushioning material when packing china boxes or electronic boxes.
Packing paper is a cost-efficient and multi-purpose moving supply designed to protect fragile items. You can use it for surface protection of family heirlooms and other fragile items, to prevent shock and vibration, as well as to fill or stuff fine china and glassware for extra density and protection from movement while transferring your boxes.</description>
